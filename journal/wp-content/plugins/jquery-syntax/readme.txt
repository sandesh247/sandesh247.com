jQuery.Syntax is an extremely fast and lightweight syntax highlighter.

== Description ==

jQuery.Syntax is an extremely fast and lightweight syntax highlighter. It has dynamic loading of syntax source files and integrates cleanly using CSS or modelines. It supports a large number of different programming languages.

This WordPress plugin provides syntax highlighting using jQuery.Syntax, supporting a wide range of popular languages. It supports both block elements (pre) and inline elements (code) for highlighting.

Wrap code blocks with <code>&lt;pre class="syntax {language}"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/pre&gt;</code> where <code>{language}</code> is a jQuery.Syntax supported brush (http://www.oriontransfer.co.nz/software/jquery-syntax/examples).

Wrap inline code with <code>&lt;code class="syntax {language}"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/code&gt;</code>.

If the code has already been escaped (i.e. characters such as &lt;, &gt;, have been converted to html entities), then add <code>escaped</code> into the class list: <code>&lt;pre class="syntax escaped {language}"&gt;</code>. This will prevent the filter from doing this conversion automatically.
