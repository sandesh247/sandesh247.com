\vspace{-12pt}
\projexp{Vandalism detection in
  Wikipedia}{Stony Brook University}

\noindent We proposed a novel approach to
detecting vandalism, modelling edits and vandal edits using a
probabilistic context free grammer, and used the model to evaluate new
edits. We attained 84\% precision and 89\% recall.

\projexp{Pattern recognition in human speech}{Stony Brook University}

\noindent I built a classifier to detect the language of a human
speaker, by building an ngram model over various co-efficients of an
audio signal. The classifier attained an accuracy of 72\% and recall
of 73\%, when tested over 9 languages. I am currently working in the
Algorithms Lab, under te guidance of Prof. Steven Skiena, to improve
the performance of the classifier.

\projexp{Language detector for textual data}{Stony Brook University}

\noindent Implemented a novel algorithm, under the guidance of Yuri
Puzis, to detect the language of a given piece of text using a trie
based decision tree. The accuracy of the classification could be
increased to an arbitrary level (limited by a dictionary) while
training the decision tree.

\projexp{Social network based on recommendation}{Self and friends}

\noindent Given things you like and don't, one can predict who is
similar to you. We built this recommendation based social network on
the Google AppEngine, using Django.

\projexp{MDX query optimizer}{Neorithm Technologies}

\noindent Given a high level declarative user query in XML, I developed a
translator to transform the user query into an optimized MDX query for
a Microsoft Analysis Services OLAP warehouse.

\projexp{Versioned document management datastore}{Neorithm Technologies}

\noindent I developed a datastore to store files, and exposed an API
in C\#. The datastorehad versioning support, and supported multiple
implementations for actual storage of files. In particular, a
filesystem based, and a relational database backends were built.

\projexp{ATM switch}{Finacus Technologies} 

\noindent Built a daemon to run on ATMs, and carry out transactions
with banks using the Diebold and NCR protocols. The daemon was written
using the Microsoft.Net framework and was extensible to support other
protocols.

\projexp{Web application development framework}{Finacus Technologies}

\noindent Built a web applicaiton development framework, consisting of
UI elements (ASP.net controls), an ORM, workflows and code
generators. These greatly reduced the development time and provided
independence from 3rd party vendors.

\projexp{\textit{Rater} extensions}{Amdocs} 

\noindent Developed various daemons and C++ extensions to support the
telecom billing processes of Amdocs' \textit{Rater} product, on Sun
Sparc and AIX systems. I travelled to Israel and Russia to test and
production support of the product.

\projexp{The Distributed DataBase}{Vidyavardhini College of
  Engineering} 

\noindent Developed the parser, query execution engine and GUI
for \href{http://tddb.sf.net} {\textbf{T}he \textbf{D}istributed
  \textbf{D}ata\textbf{B}ase (TDDB)}, a true distributed database
built from the ground up, which conforms to the SQL-92 syntax

\projexp{Email Server}{Vidyavardhini College of Engineering} 

\noindent Built an email server in JSP/servlets, where the
communication between the server and client was done through web
services.

\projexp{Wordlist trainer}{Self}

\noindent Built a website to help students prep for wordlists for
exams like the GRE. It uses and AJAX interface, and a unique approach
to learning - \textit{revise that which you did not know the last
  time}, taking out the complexity to manually mark ``hard'' words.

\projexp{Various jQuery plugins}{Self}

\noindent Built various jQuery plugins during the course of my
employment in Neorithm Technologies, while improving usaility in web
applications. Some of them can be seen in online repositories linked
at the end of this resume.
