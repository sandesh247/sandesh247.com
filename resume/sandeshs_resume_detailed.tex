\vspace{-12pt}
\projexp{Vandalism detection in
  Wikipedia}{Stony Brook University}

\noindent Hypothesised and validated an NLP approach to detecting
vandalism, by modeling good and vandal edits using a probabilistic
context free grammar, and evaluating new edits, attaining 84\%
precision and 89\% recall.

\projexp{Pattern recognition in human speech}{Stony Brook University}

\noindent Built a classifier to detect the language of a human
speaker, by building an ngram model over various features of an audio
signal. The classifier attained an accuracy of 72\% and recall of
73\%, when tested over 9 languages.

\projexp{Language detector for textual data}{Stony Brook University}

\noindent Implemented a novel algorithm, under the guidance of Yuri
Puzis, to \textbf{detect the language of a given piece of text using a
  trie based decision tree}. The accuracy of the classification could
be increased to an arbitrary level -- limited by a dictionary -- while
training the decision tree.

\projexp{Social network based on recommendation}{Self and friends}

\noindent Built a \textbf{recommendation based social network on the
  Google AppEngine}, using Django. Given things one likes and doesn't
like, people whose likes were most similar were matched up.

\projexp{Differential AJAX Server}{Neorithm Technologies}

\noindent \textbf{Modified the ASP.Net pipeline to AJAX-ify legacy
  ASP.net applications}, based on the `diff' of the pages being
transmitted to the client. Built custom modules such that the server
would only hand out a diff of the new page with respect to the older
page, and an injected javascript on the client would merge the
changes.

\projexp{Optimized MDX query generator}{Neorithm Technologies}

\noindent Developed a \textbf{translator to generate an optimized MDX
  query} for a given high level declarative user query in XML, which
was used to query a Microsoft Analysis Services OLAP warehouse. This
was part of an Anti-Money Laundering product, whose development I led.

\projexp{Versioned file storage engine}{Neorithm Technologies}

\noindent Developed a \textbf{datastore to store files}, and exposed
an API in C\#. The datastore had versioning support, and supported
multiple implementations for actual storage of files. In particular, a
file-system based, and a relational database backends were built.

\projexp{ATM switch}{Finacus Technologies} 

\noindent Built a \textbf{daemon to run on ATMs, and carry out
  transactions with banks} using the Diebold and NCR protocols. The
daemon was written using the Microsoft.Net framework and was
extensible to support other protocols.

\projexp{Web application development framework}{Finacus Technologies}

\noindent Built a \textbf{web application development framework}, consisting of
UI elements in the form of ASP.net controls, an ORM, workflows and
code generators. These greatly reduced the development time and
provided independence from 3rd party vendors.

\projexp{\textit{Rater} extensions}{Amdocs} 

\noindent Developed various daemons and C++ extensions to support the
telecom billing processes of Amdocs' \textit{Rater} product, on Sun
Sparc and AIX systems. Also traveled to Israel and Russia for
testing and production support.

\projexp{The Distributed DataBase}{Vidyavardhini College of
  Engineering} 

\noindent Developed the parser, query execution engine and GUI for
\textbf{T}he \textbf{D}istributed \textbf{D}ata\textbf{B}ase
(\url{http://tddb.sf.net}), \textbf{a true distributed database built
  from the ground up}, which conforms to the SQL-92 syntax.

\projexp{Email Server}{Vidyavardhini College of Engineering} 

\noindent Built an email server in JSP/servlets, where the
communication between the server and client was done through web
services.

\projexp{Wordlist trainer}{Self}

\noindent Built a web application \url{http://wl.sandesh247.com} to
help students prepare for wordlists for exams like the GRE. It uses an
\textbf{AJAX interface which communicates with the backend using a
  REST-api}, and has unique approach to learning - \textit{revise that
  which you did not know the last time}, taking out the tedium to
manually mark ``hard'' words.

\projexp{Various jQuery plugins}{Self}

\noindent Built various \textbf{jQuery plugins} during the course of
my employment in Neorithm Technologies, while improving usability in
web applications. Some of them can be seen in online repositories
linked at the end of this resume.
